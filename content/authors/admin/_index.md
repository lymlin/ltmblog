Lingmin Lin was an intern trained in the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, who also chosed neurology and practiced laboratory skills in the Tianjin Neurological Institute. After graduation, she joined the Wang's lab to futher train her skills. The research interest of Lin is to find the master switch of CNS disease (such as stroke and spinal cord injury) and to facilitate the rehabilitation process. As for now, it is to investigate candidate targets for ischemic stroke or spinal cord injury with booming intelectual bioinformatics or bioengineering

On the way seeking life value and innermost desires step by step, Lin has practiced several projects. Meanwhile, some computer techniques and research skills have been developed, along with sense of mission to promote the functional outcome of CNS injuries.
